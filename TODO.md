# TODO

## Completed

- [x] Research HomeAssistant bronze/silver/gold integration quality requirements
  - **Result**: Quality Scale does NOT apply to this project (it's for native HA integrations, not MQTT bridges)
  - See [dev-docs/homeassistant-integration-notes.md](dev-docs/homeassistant-integration-notes.md) for details

## Future Considerations

- [ ] Consider Go rewrite for smaller Docker images (~5-10 MB vs ~150 MB)
  - See [dev-docs/go-rust-migration-analysis.md](dev-docs/go-rust-migration-analysis.md) for analysis
